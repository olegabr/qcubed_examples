	 * Creates the jQuery Datepicker control (with a textbox)

	 * It extends the QDatepickerBoxBase class.
	 * When writing your code, use this class instead of QDatepickerBoxBase.
	 * This class is intended to be modified by the developer to add functions and alter the already present functions.
	 * Put your customizations to the standard behavior of QDatepickerBoxBase class in this class.
	 *
	 * The difference between QDatepicker class and this class is that QDatepicker will create only the jQuery
	 * control to select the date. This class will create a textbox which when clicked presents the datepicker
	 * and allows you to get the date selected in the datepicker as a string in the textbox.
