# About `framework` directory

This directory exists to allow you to override the core framework.

Changing the core framework is not recommended at all. The usual way would be to fork the repository, make changes and send us a pull request. However that is a long process and can take days or weeks; you, as a developer may not have that much time and still needs to ensure that the bug is fixed. You can override the file causing the bug in this directory safely.

Files in this folder are meant to be changed / customized. They will not be overwritten
when you upgrade QCubed.
